There was no COMMENTS file so I created one.  Since much of this test is things that I only have a passing familarity with
 I thought it might be helpful for y'all if I explain my troubleshooting process so in case I go down a rabbithole you can see why.

 First thing, I believe in TDD but as Websockets is in JS I am unsure how to use Mocha to test JS inside a Rails app so I will skip that for now.

 Currently reading Websocket docs at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html

 Going through the docs and the app code it looks like the connection language is ok, but is missing EfinChannel language (I am assuming based on docs) and the
 subsciber language in app/assets/javascripts/cable/subscriptions
